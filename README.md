# Midnight Clock

_"A broken clock is always right, you're just in the wrong place most of the time."_

This is a mini project involving a clock stuck at midnight that tells you where you should be for it to be right.

To make it as light as possible the website uses your computer's time, so if your computer's clock is wrong, the place suggested will also be wrong (captain obvious).
